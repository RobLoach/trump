Big League
I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things
I know what I'm doing, and I listen to a lot of people, I talk to a lot of people, and at the appropriate time I'll tell you who the people are
You know, it really doesn’t matter what the media write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.
Listen you motherfuckers, we're going to tax you 25 percent!
When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.
My whole life is about winning. I don't lose often. I almost never lose.
You have to think anyway, so why not think big?
I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will make Mexico pay for that wall.
There’s nobody bigger or better at the military than I am
[The press] used to think that I was really this horrible, flame-throwing, terrible tyrant. Right? Now I go on a television show, where basically what I do is I fire people, and everyone thinks I’m such a nice guy. Which tells you what a bad image I had.
Part of the beauty of me is that I am very rich.
You know, wealthy people don’t like me.
When I think I’m right, nothing bothers me.
I have a great relationship with the blacks.
I believe [the media] like making me out to be something more sinister than I really am.
I will be so good at the military your head will spin.
I had some beautiful pictures taken in which I had a big smile on my face. I looked happy, I looked content, I looked like a very nice person, which in theory I am.
No, I’m not into anal.
I don’t even consider myself ambitious.
As everybody knows, but the haters & losers refuse to acknowledge, I do not wear a "wig." My hair may not be perfect but it’s mine.
Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don’t feel so stupid or insecure, it’s not your fault
I put my name on buildings because it sells better. I don’t do it because, gee, I need that.
I think I’m like the largest or one of the largest [political] contributors. I’m maxed out every year.
My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings—even my own feelings—but I try.
Money is a little bit of a scorecard, but I don’t do it for the money. I do it because I really enjoy it. I love the creative process.
There have been many bad things said about me over the years, and in some cases they’ve been true. It doesn’t bother me. If I have a fault and somebody exposes that fault or talks about that fault, you won’t hear me complain.
It’s a great building. It’s the second-tallest building in Chicago, and I always say it was better for the people of Chicago than it was for Donald Trump.
At Trump Tower, I know everybody that goes up, and everybody that comes down
I love Oprah. Oprah would always be my first choice [for Vice President]
I will be the greatest jobs president God ever created.
Romney — I have a Gucci store that’s worth more than Romney.
How stupid are the people of Iowa?
I’ll shake hands. I shake hands with people. But it’s not something I like — look, I’m not a huge fan of Japan, but I love their custom.
With the proper woman you don’t need Viagra
My life has been about winning. My life has not been about losing.
She does have a very nice figure. I’ve said that if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.
I want five children, like in my own family, because with five, then I will know that one will be guaranteed to turn out like me,
Statistically, my children have a very bad shot. Children of successful people are generally very, very troubled, not successful. They don’t have the right shtick. You never know until they’re tested. But I do well with my children.
My marriage, it seemed, was the only area of my life in which I was willing to accept something less than perfection.
We literally have never had an argument; forget about the word ‘fight.’ We never even had an argument.
If you have the money, having children is great.
They’re remaking ‘Indiana Jones’ without Harrison Ford, you can’t do that. And now they’re making ‘Ghostbusters’ with only women. What’s going on?
I love Neil Young, and he loves me! We have a great relationship.
I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
You may get AIDS by kissing.
The [Clinton’s New York] house is right next to one of my golf courses, and, you know, I just wish I could have maybe represented him in buying the house, and her, because I think I could save them about $600,000 or $700,000.
In the second grade I actually gave a teacher a black eye — I punched my music teacher because I didn’t think he knew anything about music and I almost got expelled.
